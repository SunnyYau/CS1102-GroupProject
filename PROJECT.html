                    <h2> INTRODUCTION</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays, image compression is essential for application 
                        of reduction redundancy of image data such as colours and 
                        pixels and to improve the storage efficiency. Additionally,
                        the file is able be transmitted in an efficient format to
                        speed up the transmission.<br>
                        <br>
                        However, some image compression can affect image quality
                        of image compression slightly. Hence, there are two types
                        algorithms: <span>“lossy compression”</span> and <span>“lossless compression”</span>.<br>
                        <br>
                        The former can reduce image quality when reducing the
                        redundant and less critical data of image and particularly
                        by excessive compression (compress multiple times). 
                        Besides, another trait of lossy compression is irreversible,
                        once an image is compressed, it cannot be recovered to
                        the original version. But Lossless image compression will
                        not affect the quality of image and the image can be
                        decompressed, its compression files occupy more space
                        than lossy images.<br>
                       <br>
                        website investigates <span>different image compression algorithms
                        in different file formats</span> and provides some factors that 
                        should be considered when choosing a suitable compression
                        algorithm.
